Description:
    Explain the generator

Example:
    rails generate admin:resource Thing

    This will create:
        app/controllers/admin/things_controller.rb
        app/views/admin/things/_fields.html.haml
        app/views/admin/things/_row.html.haml

        in config/routes.rb
        resources :things

        in app/views/admin/application/_links.html.haml
        = nav_item icon("comment-o", "Things"), Thing, nav_id: [:admin, :things]
